# Sales Receipt Generator (C Console Application)

## Overview

This project is a simple **Sales Receipt Generator** written in C. It allows users to generate a sales receipt by inputting item details such as the item name, quantity, and price. The system then calculates the total price, applies a discount, and outputs a well-formatted receipt that includes item details, totals, and the footer.

## Features

- **Generate Sales Receipt**: Users can input item details, and the application will generate a receipt.
- **Calculate Totals**: Automatically calculates total price, VAT (if applicable), and applies a 10% discount.
- **Display Receipt**: Outputs a formatted sales receipt showing all purchased items, quantities, prices, and totals.
- **Additional Information**: The receipt includes the seller's information and a custom footer message.

## Program Flow

The program starts by prompting the user to select an option from a menu. If the **Generate Sales Receipt** option is selected, the user inputs item details, and the application outputs a formatted receipt.
